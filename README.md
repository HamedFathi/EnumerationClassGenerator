## Problem

> Enumeration or Enum types are an integral part of C# language. They have been around since the inception of language. Unfortunately, the Enum types also have some limitations. Enum types are not object-oriented. When we have to use Enums for control flow statements, behavior around Enums gets scattered across the application. We cannot inherit or extend the Enum types. These issues can especially be a deal-breaker in Domain-Driven Design (DDD).<br/> Read more [here](https://ankitvijay.net/2020/05/21/introduction-enumeration-class/) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/enumeration-classes-over-enum-types).
